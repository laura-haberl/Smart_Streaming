# Personalized Movie Recommendations through Chatbot Interaction

This project was developed as part of my Master's thesis.  
It is a **Next.js web application** that integrates a **CopilotKit chatbot**.  
The chatbot guides users through preference selection (e.g. genres, platforms) and provides **personalized movie recommendations** based on stored preferences and dynamic inputs.

## ‚ú® Features
- Chatbot interaction with prompt-engineered conversation flow
- Personalized movie recommendations from TMDb API
- User profile management for editing and saving preferences
- Dynamic UI adjustments based on user input
